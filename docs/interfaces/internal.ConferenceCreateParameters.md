# Interface: ConferenceCreateParameters

[internal](../modules/internal.md).ConferenceCreateParameters

The ConferenceCreateParameters interface gathers parameters settings for a requested conference.

## Properties

### dolbyVoice

• `Optional` **dolbyVoice**: `boolean`

A boolean that indicates whether an application wishes to create a conference with Dolby Voice enabled. For more information about Dolby Voice, see the [Dolby Voice](doc:guides-dolby-voice) article. By default, the parameter is set to `true`.

___

### liveRecording

• `Optional` **liveRecording**: `boolean`

A boolean that enables and disables live recording. Specify this parameter during the conference creation:
- When set to `true`, the recorded file is available at the end of the call and can be downloaded immediately.
- When set to `false`, the [remix API](ref:introduction-to-remix-api) must be called after the conference to generate and retrieve the recorded file.

This parameter does not start the recording; use the [start](doc:rn-client-sdk-references-recordingservice#start) method to turn it on. For more information, see the [Recording Conferences](doc:guides-recording-conferences) article.

___

### rtcpMode

• `Optional` **rtcpMode**: [`RTCPMode`](../enums/internal.RTCPMode.md)

The bitrate adaptation mode for video transmission. The parameter triggers a server to monitor the receivers’ available bandwidth. Based on the analyzed value, the server informs the video sender to automatically adjust the quality of the transmitted video streams.

___

### ttl

• `Optional` **ttl**: `number`

The time to live defines the number of seconds a conference is kept running when empty. A minimum of 30 seconds is given when creating the conference to allow time for participants to join. The default value is 0.

___

### videoCodec

• `Optional` **videoCodec**: [`Codec`](../enums/internal.Codec.md)

The preferred video codec that is used during a conference, either H264 or VP8. By default, the SDK uses the H264 codec.

___

### spatialAudioStyle

• `Optional` **spatialAudioStyle**: [`SpatialAudioStyle`](../enums/internal.SpatialAudioStyle.md)

Defines how the spatial location should be communicated between the SDK and the Dolby.io server.

Setting the spatial audio style is supported only on SDK 3.6 and later. The earlier SDK versions support only the individual mode.
