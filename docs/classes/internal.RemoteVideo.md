## Methods

### start

▸ **start**(`participant`): `Promise`<`void`\>

If the local participant used the stop method to stop receiving video streams from selected remote participants,
the start method allows the participant to start receiving video streams from these participants.
The start method does not impact the video transmission between remote participants and a conference and does not
allow the local participant to force sending remote participants’ streams to the conference or to the local participant.

The start method requires a few seconds to become effective.

| `participant` | [`Participant`](../interfaces/internal.Participant.md) | The selected remote participant who is locally muted through the stop method. |
